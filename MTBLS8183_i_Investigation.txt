Study Title	Landscape of gut microbiota and metabolites and their interaction in comorbid heart failure and depressive symptoms: a random forest analysis study
Study Description	<p>Depression is an individual risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF). Recent studies show that gut microbiota and metabolites have critical role in comorbid HF and depressive symptoms. We recruited 95 subjects including 35 HF patients with depressive symptoms (HF-DS), 36 HF patients without depressive symptoms (HF-NDS) and 24 healthy controls (HC). The 16S rRNA, metagenome sequencing and untargeted metabolomic analysis were employed to test fecal samples. Our analysis found there was a significant difference composition of gut microbiota in HF-DS, HF-NDS and HC populations. At the genus level, Mediterranea, Tolumona and Parabacteroides were significantly increased in HF-DS patients compared with HF-NDS patients, while Pedobacter, Azospirillum and Ruminiclostridium were significantly decreased. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory mediators (abietic acid, quinic acid, linoleic acid, etc) and neurotransmitters (catechin, serotonin, tryptamine, phenylethylamine, etc) were reduced in HF-DS. The enrichment analysis revealed that the gut microbiota highly conformed with the functional pathways of metabolites, and amino acid-related metabolism, fatty acid-related metabolism and cAMP signaling pathways may be crucial biological mechanisms involved in the development of comorbid depression and HF. Finally, Cloacibacillus and alpha-tocopherol were determined as diagnostic markers for HF-DS patients.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>IMPORTANCE:</strong> There is increasing evidence that alterations in gut microbial composition and function are associated with cardiovascular or psychiatric disease. Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate the taxonomic and functional characterization of the microbiota in HF patients who also have depressive symptoms. In this cross-sectional study, Cloacibacillus and alpha-tocopherol were determined as new diagnostic markers. Furthermore, intestinal microecosystem disorders are closely linked to depressive symptoms in HF patients, providing a new reference viewpoint for understanding the gut-heart/brain axis.</p>

Study Protocol Description	<p>In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 96 patients with HF who attended the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between December 2020 and November 2021, and 24 HC who had a physical examination. HF patients met the 2016 ESC guideline criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure<strong>[1]</strong>, an integration of at least one of the following: elevated natriuretic peptide levels; objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or body circulation stasis, including imaging (e.g., chest radiograph and echocardiogram); and resting or stress hemodynamic monitoring (e.g., right heart catheter and pulmonary artery catheter). Furthermore, the following participants were excluded from the study: (i) taking probiotics or antibiotics within 2 weeks before the trial; (ii) comorbid with autoimmune diseases, infections, malignancies and acute coronary syndromes; (iii) comorbid with cerebrovascular embolism, respiratory diseases and other diseases influencing the intestinal microbiota; and (iv) unable to complete depression scale evaluations or to retain feces. HF patients were scored by the PHQ-9 self-rating scale, a nine-item questionnaire that is often used to screen patients for depressive symptoms. Ultimately, 71 heart failure (HF) patients were recruited in this research, with scores ≥10 in the HF patients with depressive symptoms (HF-DS) group (n = 35) and &lt;10 in the HF patients without depressive symptoms (HF-NDS) group (n = 36), and 24 healthy controls (HC) who had a physical examination. All patients were treated based on the current HF management guidelines, and important clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. This study was authorized by the Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (No. 2021140) and complied with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants (or their immediate family members) gave informed consent. Fresh fecal samples (5-10 g) from all subjects within 48 h of admission and immediately transferred to collection tubes fitted with fecal stabilizers and stored in a -80 °C cryogenic refrigerator until subsequent testing.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: 'P 'and 'R' represent the level of ejection fraction (EF) in patients with heart failure.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Ponikowski P, Voors AA, Anker SD, Bueno H, Cleland JG, Coats AJ, Falk V, González-Juanatey JR, Harjola VP, Jankowska EA, Jessup M, Linde C, Nihoyannopoulos P, Parissis JT, Pieske B, Riley JP, Rosano GM, Ruilope LM, Ruschitzka F, Rutten FH, van der Meer P; Authors/Task Force Members; Document Reviewers. 2016 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure: The Task Force for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).

PMID:27207191.</p>	<p>The frozen fecal was blended with methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and extracted by sonication in an ice water bath for 20 min. The extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C (13,000 rpm) for 10 min and the supernatant was dried. The extracts were then mashed with methoxyamine hydrochloride pyridine (CNW Technologies GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany) solution and derivatized.</p>	<p>The derivatived samples were analyzed on an Agilent 7890B gas chromatography system coupled to an Agilent 5977A MSD system (Agilent Technologies Inc., CA, USA). A DB-5MS fused-silica capillary column (30 m x 0.25mm x 0.25 μm, Agilent J &amp; W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) was utilized to separate the derivatives. Helium (&gt;99.999%) was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min through the column. The injector temperature was maintained at 260 °C. Injection volume was ** μL by splitless mode. The initial oven temperature was 60 °C held at 60 °C for 0.5 min, ramped to 125 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min, to 210 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, to 270 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, to 305 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min and finally held at 305 °C for 5 min.</p>	<p>The temperature of MS quadrupole and ion source (electron impact) was set to 150 and 230 °C, respectively. The collision energy was 70 eV. Mass spectrometric data was acquired in a full-scan mode (50-500 m/z), and the solvent delay time was set to 20 min. The QCs were injected at regular intervals throughout the analytical run to provide a set of data from which repeatability could be assessed.</p>	<p>The obtained GC/MS raw data in .D format were transferred to .abf format via software Analysis Base File Converter for quick retrieval of data. Then, data were imported into software MS-DIAL, which performs peak detection, peak identification, MS2Dec deconvolution, characterization, peak alignment, wave filtering and missing value interpolation. Metabolite characterization is based on LUG database. A data matrix was derived. The 3D matrix includes: sample information, the name of the peak of each substance, retention time, retention index, mass-to-charge ratio and signal intensity. In each sample, all peak signal intensities were segmented and normalized according to the internal standards with RSD greater than 0.3 after screening. After the data was normalized, redundancy removal and peak merging were conducted to obtain the data matrix. The matrix was imported in R to carry out Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to observe the overall distribution among the samples and the stability of the whole analysis process. Orthogonal Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were utilized to distinguish the metabolites that differ between groups. To prevent overfitting, 7-fold cross-validation and 200 Response Permutation Testing (RPT) were used to evaluate the quality of the model. Variable Importance of Projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS-DA model were used to rank the overall contribution of each variable to group discrimination. A two-tailed Student’s T-test was further used to verify whether the metabolites of difference between groups were significant. Differential metabolites were selected with VIP values greater than 1.0 and p-values less than 0.05.</p>	<p>The metabolic characterization of the data was subsequently analyzed per the LUG database.</p>
