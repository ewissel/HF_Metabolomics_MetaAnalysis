Study Title	Gut butyrate-producers confer post-infarction cardiac protection.
Study Description	The gut microbiome and its metabolites are increasingly implicated in several cardiovascular diseases, but their role in human myocardial infarction (MI) injury responses have yet to be established. To address this, we examined stool samples from 77 ST-elevation MI (STEMI) patients using 16 S V3-V4 next-generation sequencing, metagenomics and machine learning. Our analysis identified an enriched population of butyrate-producing bacteria. These findings were then validated using a controlled ischemia/reperfusion model using eight nonhuman primates. To elucidate mechanisms, we inoculated gnotobiotic mice with these bacteria and found that they can produce beta-hydroxybutyrate, supporting cardiac function post-MI. This was further confirmed using HMGCS2-deficient mice which lack endogenous ketogenesis and have poor outcomes after MI. Inoculation increased plasma ketone levels and provided significant improvements in cardiac function post-MI. Together, this demonstrates a previously unknown role of gut butyrate-producers in the post-MI response.

Study Protocol Description	<p>The plasma were withdraw from patients with confirmed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (defined as STEMIT1) and 14-30 days after intervention (defined as STEMIT2).&nbsp;Samples were kept at -80 °C for later analysis. Age-matched control plasma were obtained from Taiwan Biobank.</p>	<p>The plasma samples were deprived of protein by mixing 10 μL of the plasma samples with 90 μL of methanol. The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 15 min and supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm PP membrane (RC-4, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany).&nbsp;Please update this protocol description</p>	<p>The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 15 min and supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm PP membrane (RC-4, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). A total of 3 repeated analysis was performed for each sample using Agilent 1290 UHPLC system coupled with 6540-QTOF (UHPLC-QTOF) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).</p>	<p>A total of 3 repeated analysis was performed for each sample using Agilent 1290 UHPLC system coupled with 6540-QTOF (UHPLC-QTOF) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).&nbsp;</p>	<p>Obtained potential metabolite features were normalized by sum of total peak area, log transformed and autoscaled (mean-centered and divided by the standard deviation of each variable) prior to statistical analysis using MetaboAnalyst 5.0</p>	<p>Acquired total ion chromatogram was processed with True Ion Pick (TIPick) algorithm for background subtraction and peak picking.&nbsp;Peaks were identified by matching m/z to an established in-house database: the National Taiwan University MetaCore Metabolomics Chemical Standard Library.&nbsp;</p>
