The highest concentration is in the brain, where it plays an important role in making other neurotransmitters and some steroid hormones bind to their receptors.[4] In other tissues, it mediates cell signal transduction in response to a variety of hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors and participates in osmoregulation.[5] In most mammalian cells the concentrations of myo-inositol are 5 to 500 times greater inside cells than outside them.[6] ",
