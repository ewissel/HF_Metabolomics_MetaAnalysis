#PROJECT
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Mayo Metabolomics Pilot and Feasibility Award: Metabolomics of Exhaled Breath
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Condensate in Decompensated Heart Failure
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Metabolomics is a large-scale approach to monitoring as many as possible of the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	compounds involved in cellular processes in a single assay to derive metabolic
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	profiles. Compared with genomics or proteomics, metabolomics reflects changes in
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	phenotype and therefore function. Nearly all the blood volume-cardiac output in
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	humans flows through the lungs at a rate of 5L/min and traverses through
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	capillaries with a very thin blood-gas barrier (approximately 2μm, 600–800
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	nm; in some places <200 nm) to allow sufficient gas diffusion. However, there is
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	evidence that many other biochemicals from the blood can be found in the exhaled
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	air. Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a relatively new,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	noninvasive method that allows assessment of biochemical profiles that may not
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	only link to airway physiology, but also to other changing processes in the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	body. The aims of this study are: (1) Working with the Mayo Clinic Metabolomics
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Resource Core Laboratory to develop the optimal method for performing
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	metabolomics of EBC, (2) Collecting and metabolomic profiling of the EBCs from
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	patients with heart failure; (2) Comparing the profiles of these patients
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	obtained during stable and acute exacerbation periods as well as during recovery
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	from a decompensation; (3) Comparing the profiles of these patients with age and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	gender matched controls; (4) Correlation of EBC metabolomic profiles with
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	clinical phenotypes. The proposed metabolomics profiles would be obtained from
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	patients involved in IRB approved, ongoing, primarily NIH funded studies focused
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	on understanding pulmonary congestion in heart failure patients. This includes a
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	recently started project capturing patients as they present in the emergency
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	room with decompensated heart failure. Phenotyping for this study includes novel
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	measures of pulmonary capillary recruitment, alveolar-capillary conductance,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	pulmonary capillary blood volume, thoracic CT imaging combined with in-hospital
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	clinical data, including blood biomarkers such as BNP and catecholamines.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Measurements are performed upon admission (within 24hours) and then repeated
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	just prior to dismissal. In addition, we would collect EBC on stable HF patients
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	and in age and gender matched controls healthy controls from our other ongoing
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	studies. The overall aim will be to identify novel patterns or biomarkers for
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	developing a point-of-care test (POC) for tracking disease status in HF
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	patients.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	The samples were collected in Dr. Bruce Johnson lab, at the Department of
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic. EBC samples were collected using Jaeger
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	EcoScreen cooling unit (-20°C). Patients were breathing through mouth piece
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	while wearing a nose clip during 30 minutes. Saliva was collected from the same
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	patients during last 15 minutes. The samples were frozen immediately after
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	collection.
#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	We will focus initially on patients with classic systolic HF who are admitted to
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	St Mary’s Hospital with decompensated disease. These patients are currently
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	being studied to quantify changes in lung water during the “recompensation”
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	diuresis in the hospital and the related changes in alveolar gas conductance and
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	breathing pattern to develop a predictive algorithm for likelihood of
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	readmission, but also to obtain a better understanding of fluid regulation in
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	the lungs. As these subjects are recruited, we will recruit age and sex matched
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	stable HF patients going through similar testing in parallel running studies as
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	well as age and sex matched control subjects. We will target 12 subjects per
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	group and in addition to the EBC collection we will obtain saliva samples and
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	blood at the same time points.
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	EBC: Transfer 800μl aliquots of EBC samples into a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tubes
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	and dry down (lyophilize) each sample in a centrifugal vacuum evaporator for 4-6
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	h. Apply no heating during the drying process. In the dried EBC samples add
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	250μl of phosphate buffer and 250μl of 4mM TSP-d4 solution. Vortex for 20 s.
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Transfer the solution to 5mm NMR tube.
